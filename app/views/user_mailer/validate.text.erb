None Of The Above project seeks an open election.
------------------------------------------------

We are concerned about the "Lesser Of Two Evils" scenario both the Rs and the Ds are pushing. We do not want people voting for either Trump or Clinton because they are scared. There is more information https://blog.oftheabove.com

Confirming means that <%= @user %> will probably do what they pledge to do.

<%= @user %> has pledged to NOT vote for either Trump or Clinton. <%= @user %> has pledged to vote for someone else instead. They are asking you to CONFIRM that they are probably going to do what they pledge to do. You can confirm this email by putting this link into a browser <%= @url %>. You will be helping us out. And, if enough people break away from the Rs and the Ds, we may change the course of the election.
