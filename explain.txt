We have <strong>unlimited choices</strong> of coffee drinks, pickles, breakfast cereal, and pants. We have <strong>two</strong> choices for President of the United States. We think that's wrong.

Both the Rs and the Ds would like you to believe that "if you don't vote for us, then you are handing the election to your enemy." What if enough people voted <strong>neither</strong> R nor D? Answer: we would have a legitimate election, where we would choose from candidates based on policy and trust -- instead of voting for the candidate that scares us the least.

This is true of the <strong>presidential</strong> election, and all the elections <strong>down-ballot, too</strong>.

Political parties are not something originally intended for this country. Until Madison, there was only one party. Parties formed out of common aspirations and beliefs. Today, the two major parties exist only to <strong>make sure that they keep existing</strong>. The parties now attempt to restrict our choices, not unify our voices. Seems like it is time to de-fang the major parties. Seems like we should be free to choose candidates based on merit.

<strong>What is this project?</strong> The project exists for one reason only: attempt to rally enough pledges from people who were going to vote R or D, and have them promise vote something else. If enough people pledge, then the fear of "throwing away your vote" on a non R or D candidate diminishes.

<strong>Is this project supporting a candidate?</strong> No. Well, the picture here is of Bella the Dog. If you can't think of anybody else to vote for, write her in. On the one hand, she has not mishandled classified documents in the past, nor is she truth-challenged. On the other hand, she will not start each thought praising herself and being completely unpredictable in a scary way. So, in our view, Bella the Dog has many qualities which make her preferable to either of the R or D candidates. She loves everybody (especially people who give her snacks), tries to listen to everybody, does not dissemble, accepts her shortcomings, and wants only the best for you. She is shaky on foreign policy, fiscal responsibility, government overreach, and nominating justices to the Supreme Court. So, you may want to use her as a fall-back candidate.

<strong>Is this project raising money?</strong> No.

<strong>Is this project backed by anybody besides a few folks in a garage?</strong> No.

<strong>If I give you my email, are you going to spam me?</strong> No. Promise.

<strong>If I tell you my zipcode, are you going to spy on me or tell anybody where I live?</strong> No. Promise.

<strong>Can I delete the information I give you, if I decide the project gives me the creeps later?</strong> Yes.

<strong>What if my pledge to not vote R or D is a lie, and I vote for one of the major parties anyway?</strong> Go ahead. Your right to vote your conscience is absolute in our view. If you think you will trick somebody by lying, well, we aren't going to stop you. Usually, the worst punishment you can get for lying is having to live with your own dishonesty. But now we're getting preachy. This project is honor-based. We think that Americans understand how important voting is. And we believe that nearly every American has some deep-down strength to do what they say they will do.

<strong>Anything else I should know about this project?</strong> Plenty. We have tried to assemble some basic information about things like write-ins, alternative parties, and perhaps some history. If you wish to contribute to the information, send us your stuff, and we'll try to include it. If you are looking for something and cannot find it, let us know, and we'll try to track it down.
